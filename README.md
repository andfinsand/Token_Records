- Create an account and password to access your NFTs.

- Organize NFTs on the "Collection", "Sold", or "Watchlist" page.

- Transfer NFT images between pages (Watchlist --> Collection --> Sold) to track trade status or save to individual pages. 

- Each NFT can be clicked to view image and information.

- Live floor prices for collections are displayed through an API from magiceden.io. This requires inputting the tokens mint address during creation.

- Profits and losses are calculated based on live floor prices or users sale/purchase prices.

Roadmap:
